## Task Description

![alt_text](https://i.imgur.com/Li7Uiq0.png)

You will now build a Data Cleaning Agent that automates the process of cleaning datasets, saving analysts valuable time. This agent will allow users to upload a dataset, process it through automated cleaning routines, and download the clean version.

<details>
    <summary>Python</summary>

The agent will leverage Python libraries like pandas for data processing and Streamlit for the front end. If you are confident in Python or have experience in data processing, feel free to extend the application with optional advanced tasks to make it stand out as a portfolio project!

**We will be using Streamlit for this, as well as LangChain.**
</details>

<details>
    <summary>JavaScript</summary>

We recommend using Next.js, and in particular <a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template">the Next.js LangChain starter template</a>. It includes an example of how to use agents in a Next.js project. Pick an npm package to parse the CSVs as there are some gotchas with just trying to split rows by commas. Also, you might want to consider the ability to process the data in chunks if you are taking up the optional task of handling large files. Then, data can be cleaned entirely with plain JavaScript and some prompt engineering. You can add additional packages if they are necessary for the task.

</details>

**The intended code editor for this project is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**

**If you feel confident, feel free to over-engineer the app by adding different things from the optional tasks and coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!**

Remember, you have all the tools at your disposal: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or a friend!

# Task Requirements

The exact task requirements are as follows:

1. **File Upload and Display**:
    * Allow users to upload CSV or Excel files.
    * Display the uploaded dataset in a table view.
2. **Automated Data Cleaning**:
    * Detect missing values and provide options to handle them (e.g., impute, drop).
    * Identify and flag outliers using statistical methods.
    * Remove duplicate rows.
    * Generate a report summarizing the issues found and actions taken.
3. **Downloadable Output**:
    * Provide users with the ability to download the cleaned dataset as a CSV or Excel file.
4. **UI**:
    * Build a simple, intuitive interface for all functionalities.
5. **Security and Validation**:
    * Add safeguards to validate uploaded files and prevent misuse of the app.


## Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose one or more improvements from this list.
The list is sorted by difficulty levels. 

**Caution: Some of the tasks in medium or hard categories may contain tasks with concepts or libraries that may be introduced in later sections or even require outside knowledge/time to research outside of the course.**

**Easy:**
1. Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides.
2. Improve the data cleaning agent to be more specialized for your specific domain: IT, HR, marketing, finance, etc. 
3. Add options for advanced cleaning:
    * Handle column name standardization.
    * Perform data type corrections (e.g., convert strings to dates or numbers).
    * Remove columns with low variance.
4. Generate a summary report that explains what cleaning actions were performed.
5. Improve error handling in your agent to provide clearer messages when issues arise.
6. Give the agent a personality–tweak responses to make them more formal, friendly, or concise based on user needs.

**Medium:**
1. Add all of the OpenAI settings (models, temperature, frequency, etc.) for the user to tune as sliders/fields.
2. Deploy your app to the Internet. 
3. Calculate and provide output to the user on the price of the prompt.
4. Read [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) documentation, think of your own improvement, and implement it.
5. Try to jailbreak (break into) your own application.
6. Provide data visualizations (line, bar, pie charts, etc.) summarizing missing values and outlier distributions. 
7. Provide the user with the ability to choose from a list of LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for this project.
8. Think of a creative way: how could you use image generation inside this project and implement it using code?
9. Enable simple rule-based filtering, such as removing rows with missing critical values.
10. Add retry logic – if the agent fails or returns an incomplete response, it automatically tries again with adjustments.

**Hard:**
1. Make your solution scalable, meaning that you can clean large CSV files: 100MB or even in the GB range.
2. Deploy your app to one of these cloud providers: Gemini, AWS, or Azure.
3. Implement a tool that allows agents to call an external API.
4. Think of ways to add vector databases to the project (saving, comparing and calculating vectors) and implement it.
5. Use open-source LLMs (not Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for the project.
6. Make your program multi-agent. Some inspiration: one agent would assess how clean the dataset is, another could provide possible cleaning options, and the third could perform the actual cleaning.
7. [Fine-tune](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) an LLM and use it in your project.
8. Enable user management. Add login functionality and register functionality.
9. Benchmark different LLMs (or even open-source ones) to see which LLM performs better for this project. Save the results. Present the results for the evaluator.

## Evaluation Criteria

* The learner understands the basic principles of how the program works.
* The learner's project works as intended; the agent successfully cleans the dataset to a sufficient degree.
* The learner understands the potential problems with the application. He can offer suggestions on improving the code and the project.
* The learner understands differences between different types of agents.
* The learner understands when to use RAG, prompt engineering, Chains or Agents.
* The program has at least one agent and that agent uses tools for the data cleanup.
* For the maximum mark, complete **at least 2 medium and hard optional tasks**.

# How to get started with Streamlit (Python)

It is very likely that you are seeing and hearing about Streamlit for the first time. No worries!

It's a fantastic framework for creating interactive web apps using Python, particularly for **data visualization**, **machine learning demos**, and **quick prototyping**.

You don't need to know much about front-end things, like HTML, CSS, JS, React, or others, to build apps! Streamlit will do the basics of the front-end for you by just writing Python code.

**Learning Streamlit:**

* You can get started by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&ab_channel=pixegami). 
* After that, check out their [page](https://streamlit.io/). 
* Check their documentation on [page elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference). 
* A good starting point could be their ["Get Started" section](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started).
* Lastly, GeeksForGeeks also offers a good tutorial on [Streamlit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-beginners-guide-to-streamlit/).
* [YouTube short.](https://youtube.com/shorts/iPj6QKMd8qA?si=d0i19vdfr3x4jAn0)
* Tutorial on using Streamlit in [VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2siBrMsqF44&ab_channel=TechWithTim).

## How to use Next.js for agents (JS)

You can either choose one of the following:

- Next.js from scratch, either `create-next-app` or the project template from the previous project
- (Recommended) <a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template">LangChain's Next.js template</a>
- some other JS full-stack framework or a Python backend + JS frontend project

We recommend using the LangChain's Next.js template and its <a href="https://langchain-nextjs-template.vercel.app/agents">agents example</a> in particular. You will be primarily working with the `app/api/chat/agents/route.ts` file.

For Next.js we expect you to integrate the "Upload document" functionality, which would allow uploading a CSV file for data cleaning.

## Approach to solving the task

* 1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:
    * Understanding this task better
    * Writing the code
    * Improving the code
    * Understanding the code
* If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in the previous sprints and check out additional resources.
* Feel free to revisit the various Google Colab notebooks in Sprint 3. They can help you to understand agents better.
* If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs.
* Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else—whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.
* If you still can't solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.
